# Leveraging Dynamic Programming for Reinforcement Learning
12.12.2024, 18:00 - 20:00 (TN O1.46)


## Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) first gained widespread attention when AlphaGo defeated 9-dan Go master Lee Sedol in 2016. After a period of relative quiet, RL is experiencing a resurgence, driven by advancements such as RL with human feedback for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and diffusion-pre-trained RL models in robotics, which are showing significant improvements.
To stay ahead of this trend and deepen our understanding of RL algorithms, it's essential to revisit their foundation: dynamic programming (DP). Mastery of DP not only enhances your grasp of RL but also demonstrates strong general programming skills, a common topic in technical interviews.
Join us for an evening dedicated to DP, where we'll explore the theory, tackle quizzes, and solve coding challenges from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) and [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (because Christmas is coming ðŸ™‚).
Bring your laptops if you'd like to code along, and enjoy an evening of learning, coding, and discussions, complete with drinks and snacks!
